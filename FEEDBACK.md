# OO pracitce part 1

looks good! I like that you seperated your run file so that you can store all of your instances there instead of in the file with the class. I think it looks great well done!

# part 2

I dont have any notes! It looks really good well done! if you feel that this doesnt take to long feel free to get creative and add some fun CLI in there!
