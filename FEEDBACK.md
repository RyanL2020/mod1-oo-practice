# OO pracitce part 1

looks good! I like that you seperated your run file so that you can store all of your instances there instead of in the file with the class. I think it looks great well done!

# part 2

I dont have any notes! It looks really good well done! if you feel that this doesnt take to long feel free to get creative and add some fun CLI in there!

# Part Four - Associations
- Make sure all your model files are in the right folder! I moved it this time. 
- `appointment.rb` looks good!
- In `patient.rb` you shouldn't have doctor in the initialize or attr's anymore because a Patient no longer belongs to a doctor. Your other new methods look spot on.
- In `doctor.rb` the `Doctor#appointments` and `Doctor#patients` methods will look very much like their equivalents in `patient.rb` because for both you will have to find out about the other (ie Doctor finding out about its Patients and vice versa) throughhh Appointments.
